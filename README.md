    docker build ./src -t  cyrilkurian/coinbase_scraper:2.0.0
    docker run -p 0.0.0.0:5001:5001/tcp cyrilkurian/coinbase_scraper:0.0.1

The above steps are in github action steps as well

## Github Actions
Github actions are defined in .github/workflows

## Helm
Helm deployment and slack messaging are also defined in workflows.
Helm charts are defined in ./helm


## Terraform deployments

Commands:

    terraform init
    terraform plan

Terraform sample plan:

    Terraform will perform the following actions:
